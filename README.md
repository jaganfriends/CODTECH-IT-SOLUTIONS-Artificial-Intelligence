# Data Analysis with Python(Task-01)

## Description:
This project provides scripts and Jupyter notebooks for performing data analysis tasks using Python. It includes data cleaning, exploration, visualization, and basic statistical analysis.

## Files:
- `data_analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing data analysis workflows.
- `data_cleaning.py`: Python script for cleaning raw data.
- `visualization.py`: Python script for generating data visualizations.
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python packages required for the project.

## Usage:
1. **Setup Environment:**
   - Install Python 3.x.
   - Install necessary dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

2. **Data Cleaning:**
   - Use `python data_cleaning.py` to clean raw data files.
   - Adjust file paths and cleaning logic in `data_cleaning.py` as needed.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Open `data_analysis.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
   - Explore datasets, perform statistical analysis, and generate insights.
   - Document findings and visualizations within the notebook.

4. **Data Visualization:**
   - Run `python visualization.py` to create visualizations from cleaned data.
   - Modify visualization techniques and parameters in `visualization.py`.

## Notes:
- Ensure data files are stored in the appropriate directories (`data/` by default).
- Customize analysis and visualizations based on specific data characteristics.
- Document assumptions, methodology, and conclusions in `data_analysis.ipynb`.


# Machine Learning Model Evaluation and Comparison(Task-02)

## Description:
This project focuses on evaluating and comparing multiple machine learning models for a specific task. It includes steps for training models, evaluating their performance using various metrics, and selecting the best-performing model based on defined criteria.

## Tasks:
- **Model Selection**: Choose diverse algorithms (e.g., decision trees, SVMs, neural networks) for comparison.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Measure model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score (for classification tasks), and mean squared error (for regression tasks).
- **Comparison**: Compare models statistically and visually to determine the most suitable model for deployment.

## Files:
- `train.py`: Python script for training machine learning models.
- `evaluate.py`: Python script for evaluating model performance on test data.
- `compare_models.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for visual comparison of model metrics.
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python packages required for the project.

## Usage:
1. **Setup Environment:**
   - Install Python 3.x.
   - Install required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

2. **Training Models:**
   - Modify `train.py` to include different algorithms and hyperparameter configurations.
   - Run `python train.py` to train models on training data.

3. **Evaluation:**
   - After training, execute `python evaluate.py` to assess models on test data.
   - Evaluate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

4. **Model Comparison:**
   - Open `compare_models.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
   - Visualize and compare model performance using appropriate plots (e.g., ROC curves, confusion matrices).

## Notes:
- Ensure datasets are appropriately preprocessed and split into training and test sets.
- Adjust hyperparameters and model architectures to optimize performance.
- Document assumptions, methodologies, and conclusions in `compare_models.ipynb`.
